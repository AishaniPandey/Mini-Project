# Mini-Project

1)This is a project made using Flutter and Basics of Machine Learning in order to predict the type of Fertilizer to be used in a particular area given Temperature, 
Humidity , Moisture, Soil Type, Crop Type, Nitrogen, Potassium, Phosphorous levels (NPK Ratio).

->We will analyse the soil quality and weather conditions give the best type of fertilizer to be used to help the farmers with the help of machine learning using 
the technique of random forest.

->Our app will help the farmers to decide what type of fertilizers to use on a particular crop for a healthy yield. 

->This information should be available to the farmers in user friendly environment, easy to access, cost-effective interfaces. 

2)Basic Technologies used in this project are:

-> A dataset [from Kaggle]

-> Google colaboratory [for implementation of backend]

-> Flutter [for making app that is frontend]
